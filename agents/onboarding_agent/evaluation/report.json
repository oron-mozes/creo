      "description": "User confirms the business details presented",
      "score": 0.5,

      "description": "New user provides minimal information, agent should ask for more",
      "score": 0.7,
      "rationale": "The agent correctly identifies the missing information and provides a warm welcome. However, it violates the 'Ask Minimally: One question at a time' instruction by asking for both name and location in a single turn, despite having extracted the service type."

      "rationale": "The agent failed to extract the business name 'EcoWear' from the user's prompt, which was explicitly provided. With the business name and location ('LA'), the agent should have performed a targeted search for 'EcoWear LA' instead of a generic search for 'sustainable fashion brands in Los Angeles' and then asking for a website.

However, some of the location examples provided (e.g., 'Downtown Manhattan', 'Online', 'Nationwide') do not align with the strict 'City, Country minimum' format required by the agent's instructions for the 'location' field, which could lead to issues in data collection and normalization."

      "rationale": "The agent correctly performed a search based on the provided TikTok handle and acknowledged the search result. It then appropriately asked for the missing required business information (name and service type). The only minor deviation is asking for two pieces of information at once, though the instructions allow for 'name and industry' together if zero context, which applies here after the search failed to find them."
