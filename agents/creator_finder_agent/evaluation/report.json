      "rationale": "The agent correctly parsed the tricky budget range '100-10000$' as $100 - $10,000 without modification, accurately calculated the subscriber range based on the instructions, and followed the conversational flow by explaining the budget calculation and then asking for missing optional information."

      "rationale": "The agent correctly parsed the K notation for the budget and performed a search for creators. However, it failed to explain the budget-to-subscriber calculation as instructed and incorrectly classified the 'within_budget' status for the top 10 results, as their estimated minimum prices were below the specified 90% threshold of the user's minimum budget."

All 5 channels marked '✅ Within your budget' are misclassified, as their estimated minimum prices are significantly below 90% of the user's minimum budget ($7,200). One channel (Soul Food Cooking) should have been flagged as '⚠️ Above your budget' based on its maximum estimated price. The agent also missed including 'Total Views' for each channel, which was explicitly required."

It then asks for the necessary campaign details (category, budget, location) to proceed with a YouTube-specific search, while acknowledging both target audiences (Gen Z and Millennials). The 'should_recommend_ads' expected behavior seems misaligned with the agent's instructions, which define it as a 'Creator Finder Agent' for YouTube, not an ad platform advisor; therefore, not recommending ads is appropriate for this agent's role."
