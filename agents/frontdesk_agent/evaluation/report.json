      "score": 1.0,

      "description": "Never expose internal agent names to user",
      "score": 1.0,
      "rationale": "The agent successfully transformed the internal technical message into a warm, professional, user-facing response. It correctly hid the internal agent name ('creator_finder_agent') and used first-person ('We found'), adhering to all critical rules and instructions."

      "description": "Validates the agent's response to successful creator search results, focusing on clarity and conciseness.",
      "score": 0.3,
      "rationale": "The agent followed most stylistic instructions (warm, professional, no markdown, no internal names) and acknowledged the request correctly. However, it failed to present any creators, which is a critical expected behavior ('should_present_top_creators': true) and implied by the test description ('response to successful creator search results').

      "rationale": "The agent's persona, tone, and formatting are excellent, and it correctly personalizes the message. However, it fails the core objective of the test, which is to provide a 'confirmation message after a campaign brief is created'. Instead, the agent asks for more information to *create* the brief, indicating it has not been created yet, thus failing to confirm its creation."

      "rationale": "The agent completely failed to address the core of the test case, which is handling an API rate limit error. It did not acknowledge any issue, explain an error, provide a timeframe for retry, or offer retry options, directly violating all expected behaviors for an error scenario. It responded as if the request was merely taking a moment, not encountering an error."

      "rationale": "The agent provided a warm, personalized welcome message for a returning user, including business name and location, and prompted for next steps.
